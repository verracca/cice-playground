# Fetch

Use fetch to get all the posts from this API: [https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts) and render them in a list.

Create a button that makes a post request to the same API passing as a body an id, a title and body as following:

```json
{
    "id": 1,
    "title": "foo",
    "body": "bar"
}
```
