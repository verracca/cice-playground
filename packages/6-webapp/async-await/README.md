# Async await

Use fetch to make three requests in parallel to the following APIs: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1, https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/2 and https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/3 and render them in a list. Use async await where possible.

Create a button that makes another request to this API: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/404, capture the error and show the user an alert.
